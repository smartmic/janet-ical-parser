# About janet-ical-parser

janet-ical-parser, abbreviated jip, is an opinionated iCalendar (.ics) parser for the Janet Language.

The primary goal of this Janet package is to convert valid RFC 5545 iCalendar text into a mutable Janet table data structure for further processing in Janet programs.

janet-ical-parser sources and the development of the project are managed using [Fossil](https://fossil-scm.org) and are self-hosted at <https://fossil.toolsmith.eu/repo/janet-ical-parser>.

If you are reading this on a Git software forge like GitHub or Codeberg, then you are looking at a Git mirror of the self-hosting Fossil repository.
